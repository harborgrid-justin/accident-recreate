# OUTPUT CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

# This section is for configuring the output of cargo-deny

[output]
# When outputting inclusion graphs in diagnostics that include features,
# this option can be used to specify the depth at which feature edges will
# be added. This option is included since the graphs can be quite large
# and the addition of features from the crate graph to the features graph
# can be very noisy, but is useful for some diagnostic purposes.
feature-depth = 1

# ============================================================================
# GRAPH OPTIONS
# ============================================================================

# This section is for configuring graph output options

[graph]
# If true, metadata will be collected with `--all-features`
all-features = false

# If true, metadata will be collected with `--no-default-features`
no-default-features = false

# If set, these features will be enabled when collecting metadata
features = []

# ============================================================================
# TARGET CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================

# This section is for configuring target-specific checks

[targets]
# The target triple to check
# If not specified, all targets will be checked
# targets = [
#     "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu",

# ============================================================================
# CUSTOM ADVISORIES
# ============================================================================

# You can add custom advisories here for internal/private issues

# Example:
# [[advisories.custom]]
# id = "CUSTOM-001"
# package = "some-crate"
# version = "< 1.2.3"
# description = "Internal security issue"
# severity = "high"

# ============================================================================
